        <h1>What is Income Tax?</h1>
        <p>
            Income tax is a tax imposed by a government on the income earned by individuals and businesses within its jurisdiction.
            Individuals are typically required to file an income tax return annually, reporting their income from various sources, such as wages, self-employment income, investment income, and other types of income. The tax liability is then calculated based on the individual's total income and applicable tax rates, taking into account any deductions, credits, or exemptions that may be available.
